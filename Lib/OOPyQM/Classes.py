""" Classes module specifications.

Module Classes holds many of the classes used by PeYeQM to
define the instances necessary for the initial statement
of a simulation problem.

List of Classes
===============

Simulation()
------------
Top level class of a FEA. It contains as attributes all other classes listed 
below.
It has
    - Definition of the problem. 
    - Details about the context of the solution.
Domain()
--------
Representation of the physical domain of a simulation. 
It has:
    - Information about regions and their discretization
    - definitions of elements, nodes and boundary conditions

Region()
--------
A region is an object that allows the identification of different material 
properties according to a previous subdivision of the Domain.

Nodes()
-------
Class Nodes represents the coordinates of the points that result from 
a discretization of a given domain. 

Elements()
----------
Class elements is a container for sets of 1D and 2D elements that can be 
of different shapes and orders. Elements are representations of the 
relation between nodes of a discretized domain.  
Current supported elements are:
    - Lines
    - Triangles
    - Quadrilaterals
Lines()
-------
An instance of class Lines() is a container of line elements. 
This class also defines common operations and attributes that 
involve line elements.

----------------
An instance of class Quadrilaterals() is a container of QUAD elements. 
This class also defines common operations and attributes that 
involve QUAD elements.

Boundaries()
------------
This class acts as a container of boundaries and their attributes.
Boundaries of a domain are the objects where edge conditions are stated.

DOF()
-----
DOF is a class that was defined for transient simulations only.
A DOF represents a degree of freedom in a dynamic problem, and has the 
necessary attributes and methods for a time dependant algorithm

    What we are trying to obtain when solving a FE problem is a function

    elements  we form an abstraction of that function. Defining smaller 
    compact suport functions that represent chunks of the domain, and 
    assembling them carefully, we can build an approximate solution 
    of complex problems whose analytical solution is out of reach.
    
    These compact suport functions are stated as interpolation functions
    of nodal values and their relative positions. 
    The idea is that knowing nodal values and the positions of nodes, 
    we are able to interpolate the solution and find the value of an 
    arbitrary point. It is however an approximation, and the precision
    of this value will be dependent of factors such as:
        - Number of nodes per element.
        - Order of the interpolation function.
        - complexity of the solution.
