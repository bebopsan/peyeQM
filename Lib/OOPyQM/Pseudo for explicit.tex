\section{
Explicit FEM method pseudo, cor the solution of transient 
simulations of electromagnetic fields.
}

Import libraries 
Define a filename for .msh, .reg and .bc input files.

Instantiate the simulation and initialize it from the 
files with the filename name.
	do:
	 read_mesh
	 read_regions
	 

Define a timestep $\delta t$ and a range for the iteration

Build the lumped mass matrix (vector) 

Define initial states $\mathbf{E}^{0}$ and $\mathbf{E}^{1}$.

for time n in timesteps: 
	
	for node in nodes:
		assemble dof's
		Solve for dof
